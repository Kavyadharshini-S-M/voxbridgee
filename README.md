# iTantra

### Offline, mesh-networked voice walkie-talkie for disaster response — in 10 Indian languages.

No internet. No cell towers. No cloud. Speak in your language, the person on the other end hears it in theirs — relayed phone-to-phone over Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth and BLE.

## Why

When a cyclone knocks out cell towers and the internet along a coastline, rescue teams and villagers still need to talk to each other — and not everyone in the affected region speaks the same language. iTantra turns any two (or more) Android phones into a walkie-talkie network that:

- needs **zero infrastructure** — no SIM, no Wi-Fi router, no data connection,
- **speaks and listens in the local language** on each end, translating in between,
- keeps working as a **multi-hop mesh** so a message can travel A → B → C even when A and C are out of each other's range,
- and can blast a **priority distress alert** to every connected node at once.

Built for the Smart India Hackathon around a disaster-management / space-comms (ISRO-styled) brief.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Offline speech pipeline** | On-device STT ([AI4Bharat IndicConformer](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/NeMo), INT8) with [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) for real-time sentence boundaries, and on-device TTS ([AI4Bharat Indic-TTS](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/Indic-TTS) FastPitch + HiFi-GAN) — zero network calls, ever. |
| **Streaming synthesis** | Long messages are chunked sentence-by-sentence and played back as each chunk finishes synthesizing, instead of waiting for the whole utterance to render before any sound plays. |
| **Cross-language relay** | The sender speaks their language; the receiver hears it in *theirs* — translated automatically in between. |
| **True mesh transport** | UDP broadcast discovery, TCP over Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth RFCOMM, and BLE scan/advertise, all live at once. |
| **Multi-hop relay** | A node holds every live link simultaneously and flood-relays unseen packets onward (TTL-bounded, dedup-cached) — two out-of-range phones can still talk through a third. |
| **Priority distress broadcast** | One tap sends a `CRITICAL_DISTRESS` packet to the whole mesh with a siren tone, forced max volume, and a haptic pattern. |
| **Push-to-talk or hands-free** | Classic PTT, or continuous VAD-segmented "phone mode" conversation. |
| **Per-device role** | Transceiver / STT-only / TTS-only — for mixed hearing- and speaking-impaired deployments. |
| **Mission voice log** | Every message sent and received is archived locally (Room) with language, timestamp, and alert priority. |
| **Live tactical telemetry** | Battery, signal strength, link quality, RSSI, local IP, RAM — always on screen. |

## How it works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Speaker (Node A)
    participant VAD as Silero VAD
    participant STT as IndicConformer STT
    participant MESH as Mesh Transport
    participant B as Relay (Node B)
    participant TR as Offline Translator
    participant TTS as FastPitch + HiFi-GAN TTS
    participant L as Listener (Node C)

    U->>VAD: raw microphone audio
    VAD->>STT: end-of-sentence segment
    STT->>MESH: transcribed text + language
    MESH->>B: UDP beacon / TCP / Bluetooth packet
    B-->>B: not seen before, TTL > 1 -> relay onward
    B->>MESH: forwarded packet
    MESH->>TR: text (sender language)
    TR->>TTS: text (receiver's selected language)
    TTS->>L: synthesized speech, chunk-by-chunk
```

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph NodeA["Node A — speaker"]
        MicA[Mic] --> VAD_A[Silero VAD]
        VAD_A --> STT_A[IndicConformer STT]
        STT_A --> XportA[TacticalMeshTransport]
    end

    subgraph NodeB["Node B — relay"]
        XportB[TacticalMeshTransport]
    end

    subgraph NodeC["Node C — listener"]
        XportC[TacticalMeshTransport]
        XportC --> Translate[Offline Translator]
        Translate --> TTS_C[FastPitch + HiFi-GAN TTS]
        TTS_C --> SpkC[Speaker]
    end

    XportA <-->|UDP:8888 beacon + broadcast| XportB
    XportA <-->|TCP:8889 / Bluetooth RFCOMM| XportB
    XportB <-->|flood relay, TTL-bounded| XportC
```

A is out of Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct range of C, but both are linked to B — B holds both links simultaneously and relays A's packet on to C without either endpoint configuring anything.

## Supported languages

| Language | Native | STT | TTS |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| Hindi | हिन्दी | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bengali | বাংলা | ✅ | ✅ |
| Marathi | मराठी | ✅ | ✅ |
| Telugu | తెలుగు | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tamil | தமிழ் | ✅ | ✅ |
| Gujarati | ગુજરાતી | ✅ | ✅ |
| Kannada | ಕನ್ನಡ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Malayalam | മലയാളം | ✅ | ✅ |
| Odia | ଓଡ଼ିଆ | ✅ | ✅ |
| English | English | — | ✅ |

New languages are added purely by dropping converted model files into `assets/models/<code>/` and a manifest entry — see `tools/model_conversion/`.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Ladybug or newer), JDK 17.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kavyadharshini-S-M/iTantra.git
cd iTantra
```

### Model weights

The on-device STT/TTS model weights (~2.3GB across 10 languages) are **not** committed to this repo — several individual files exceed GitHub's 100MB limit. The manifest (`app/src/main/assets/models/model_manifest.json`), tokenizer vocabularies, and TTS frontend configs *are* included, describing exactly which upstream checkpoints each language pack expects and where they came from.

To run the app with real speech, regenerate the ONNX weights with the conversion scripts under `tools/model_conversion/` (`convert_stt.py`, `export_tts.py`) against the source checkpoints listed per-language in `model_manifest.json`, and drop the output into the matching `assets/models/<code>/stt/` and `assets/models/<code>/tts/` folders. Without them, a language simply reports itself as unavailable instead of faking a result — the app runs fine, it just has nothing to say yet.

### Build & run

1. Open the project root in Android Studio and let it sync.
2. Run on two physical devices (or a device + emulator) on the same Wi-Fi network / with Bluetooth enabled, to actually exercise the mesh.
3. Grant microphone, location, and nearby-devices/Bluetooth permissions when prompted — they're required for `RECORD_AUDIO`, Wi-Fi Direct discovery, and BLE/Bluetooth scanning respectively.
